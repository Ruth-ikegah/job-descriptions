# Senior Open Source Manager

Amazon's Open Source Program is seeking an individual to manage its compliance sub-program.

Amazon has been with Open Source for a long time – a center for Perl development since the early days and a poster child for the use of Linux across the Enterprise in 2001 (when that was a shocking notion). Contributions have grown since 2007 and now we contribute to Kubernetes, Apache MXNet, Chromium, Boto, and Apache Hadoop related projects (Hive, Pig, Hadoop Core, HBase), plus many, many others. We also host our own Open Source projects – recent examples are s2n, Firecracker, Corretto, and FreeRTOS.

The Open Source Program supports Amazon and its affiliates with their Open Source needs. We get involved with business initiatives across the company and the globe - from the retail websites, to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and on to the Kindle. We oversee the company’s GitHub projects, contributions, license compliance, and provide due diligence during acquisitions. If it's related to Open Source then we'll be involved - advising and creating solutions.

As the manager of the team you will be responsible for the quality of the team's overall work along with assisting the individuals on the team to continually grow in their careers.
