* Run, improve, and design essential elements of the open source program
* Advocate for teams across Indeed who use, contribute to, and depend on open source
* Build internal collaborations that apply your open source and technical expertise
* Represent Indeed as a speaker at industry events and in external working groups
* Write code that helps you collect and analyze data 
* Contribute to the evolving vision of Indeed’s open source program

We have an engineering team embedded in the open source program. You will get to work with them in a product owner role as they write software to support our work. You’ll be able to have high level technical conversations with them. Occasionally, you’ll write code of your own to answer questions and gain insights.

Our outreach work focuses on effective interactions with external communities. We support open source projects that Indeed owns (like k8Dash), as well as contribue to projects on which Indeed depends (like Kubernetes). We consult with teams to help them get the most out of open source, as well as to give back to the community. Indeed uses a variety of languages and frameworks, you will have opportunities to learn new systems, and to collaborate closely with the folks who maintain them. 

We are Indeed’s [Open Source Program Office (OSPO)](https://opensource.indeedeng.io/). The OSPO’s mission is to inspire every Indeedian to make meaningful contributions to the open source community. We deliver this mission by driving open source culture throughout Indeed using events like Hacktoberfest, tools like the Mariner Issue Collector, and programs like the FOSS Contributor Fund. Using direct mentorship, communications, and essential tooling, we help Indeedians understand how to use open source effectively.

The open source program team is responsive, accountable, and collaborative. We share our work openly, work together to overcome challenges, celebrate our successes, and support each other through our failures. Our team values include collaboration, innovation, transparency, and customer success. We encourage a healthy work-life balance, and provide great opportunities for ongoing education and career development, as well as strong benefits. The open source team has embraced remote work from its start, and we are moving toward a “remote-first” culture.
