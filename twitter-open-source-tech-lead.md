Our Open Source Program Office (OSPO) partners with stakeholders inside and outside of the company to help them work together to solve real world problems. Twitter doesn’t just release and maintain dozens of open source projects, we sponsor Free/Open Source foundations and non-profits, host and organize meetups and conferences, and directly support open source organizations and contributors.
