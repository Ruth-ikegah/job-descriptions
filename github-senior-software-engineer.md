# Senior Software Engineer OSPO (Open Source Program Office)
**at GitHub** (Remote)

GitHub is changing the way the world builds software, and we want you to help build GitHub.

We’re looking for a few software engineers to join a passionate, collaborative, distributed group of engineers on our team.

The GitHub Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is working across the company to ensure that developers at companies can easily contribute to open source and do more of it, and that starts with GitHub’s open source contribution workflows. The open source community is the heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software. We contribute to the tools we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining our own open source projects.

We are growing the team to: 

* Build tools that reduce open source contribution friction; pilot testing them at GitHub and then scaling beyond GitHub
* Guide teams through the process of open sourcing existing closed-source products
* Support the community with best practices as they use GitHub to manage their own open source programs
* Develop core insights around open source project health, and business value

Stack: The frontend is in TypeScript and backend is primarily in Ruby/Rails, with new services being built out in Golang.

## A day in the life of a Senior Software Engineer on the team:
Our team is fully remote and distributed across the UK, Canada, US, and soon Singapore which means we work asynchronously most of the time. Your typical week would include:
* Collaborating with product managers, designers, and support to understand the problems we want to solve, exploring how we can solve them, and what our users have said about the problems and solutions so far
* Discussing and collaboratively solving engineering and product problems with engineering collaborators in GitHub Issues and PRs, Slack, or Zoom
* Opening a Pull Request to implement the next most important feature or task, or fix the most critical bug and resolving suggestions in your code reviews
* Responding to issues and review requests from other teams at GitHub and modeling/teaching best practices around this to peers
* Reviewing your teammates’ Pull Requests and providing helpful feedback and modeling/teaching best practices around this to peers
* Working with your engineering manager in your one-on-one meetings to grow your team and career
* Rotating responsibilities for oncall and giving feedback to improve the oncall process

## Responsibilities:  
* Pick new work autonomously and code solutions, working to unblock yourself when stuck either by reaching out for help or finding other solutions in an asynchronous, remote, distributed culture
* Write clear documentation, tests, and recommendations for technical problems
* Collaboratively define, scope, prioritize, and estimate work
* Drive helpful conversations around technical issues and engineering practices, suggesting improvements and ideas as you see them
* Review code and provide thoughtful, constructive feedback during code reviews
* Triage, reproduce, and debug issues reported by other coworkers for our areas of responsibility
* Give and receive feedback to grow yourself and the team
* Provide compassionate technical mentorship, pairing opportunities, and code reviews to encourage the growth of others
* Deliver complex code/features with quality and supportability

## Qualifications:
There are only a handful of folks who meet all qualifications. We care more about hiring people that have a track record of caring deeply about shipping software that helps people with their work than checking all of the qualifications off. So whether you meet all the qualifications or a partial set, **we want to hear from you**.

### Minimum Qualifications:
* Strong written communication skills
* High degree of empathy
* 4+ years experience as a full-time professional coder
* Experience with JavaScript
* Experience with Ruby on Rails
* Familiarity with Git
* Experience working asynchronously on a remote, distributed team (does not have to be professional experience)
* Ability to learn and think critically about both system design and software engineering concepts and blend those perspectives pragmatically based on project needs

### Preferred Qualifications: 
* Experience building, operating and maintaining resilient, scalable distributed services
* Experience building highly available services at scale
* Experience with CSS and HTML
* Knowledge of testing, profiling, and debugging practices
* Strong pairing skills
