# New Relic: Open Source Program Manager 

## Your Opportunity

At New Relic, we rely on many amazing projects from the community to run our business and regularly share with the world what we build internally. We are looking for an individual with proven leadership skills who is passionate about open source to start the New Relic Open Source Program Office.

You will plan, organize, scale and deliver developer-facing internal and external programs with regards to the open source community and key standards organizations. This is an exciting opportunity to work with all levels of the organization and have a lasting impact on both New Relic and the open source community at large.
